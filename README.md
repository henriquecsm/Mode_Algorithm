Algorithm to find most frequent temperature

1) Given a large dataset, this algorithm was developed to return the most frequent temperature.

2) Algorithm structure:
   - It was using 3 methods:
     a) Set generator: Provide a set of numbers to simulate data input, it is possible to resize the size of the data list;
     b) Sort numbers: It is necessary to sort the data list then algorithm can find the most frequent temperature (mode);
     c) Find the mode: Algorithm to find and return the most frequent temperature (mode);
